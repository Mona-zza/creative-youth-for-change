      <h3>Who we are</h3>
      <p>
        Creative Youth for Change (CYC) is not another NGO. We are a youth-led movement confronting injustice, building alternatives, and demanding dignity where it is denied. Born in Afghanistan and now reaching across 20+ countries, we exist because young people refuse to wait for permission to shape their futures
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Our Mission & Vision</h3>
    <div class="box">
      <p>
        To empower tomorrow’s leaders by equipping them with the skills, courage, and networks they need to create a just world. We provide not only education but also space — where young people can design, lead, and decide. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A world where every young person — especially those in crisis zones — can access education, speak truth to power, and lead movements. We are certain: youth are not the future. We are the present, and we are the change
      </p>

    <h3>Our approach</h3>
 <div class="box">
  <p>We don’t parachute solutions. We listen. We plan with local youth. We build with what we have. From WhatsApp classrooms in Afghanistan to conference halls across continents, our approach is grounded in participation, care, and measurable impact.</p>
 </div>
 <h3>Ethics & sustainability </h3>
 <div class="box">
<p>
  CYC commits to ethical practices across education, child protection, and environmental sustainability. Every project is designed to be both budget-conscious and community-centered. We resist exploitation in all its forms, and we stand firm on integrity.
